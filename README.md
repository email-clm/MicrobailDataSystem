# MicrobailDataSystem
This is a place to compile and share data for soil microbial properties. It should be noted that this dataset is for terrestrial ecosysems, not for marine ecosystems. Meanwhile, since there are many other dataset available on plant, soil carbon, root etc. This dataset focuses on soil microbial properties. A majority of data is from published literature, online data sources etc. 

Any contributions are welcome, please email Xiaofeng Xu (xxu@sdsu.edu) if you have any data to contriubte.

The data contributes are listed as below and the references are followed.
